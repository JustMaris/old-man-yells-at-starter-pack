# 👴 old-man-yells-at-starter-pack

A fun and extensive collection of "Old Man Yells At" custom emojis, generated from the original "Old Man Abe" meme, tailored for the modern workplace and popular tech tools.

Use this starter pack to perfectly express that "back in my day" frustration with modern tech stacks, confusing acronyms, and everything else that young people are into!

## 📦 What's Included?

This pack contains dozens of `.png` files, all sized and formatted for use as Slack custom emojis. The file names are optimized to be used directly as the emoji names (e.g., `old-man-yells-at-airflow.png` becomes the emoji `:old-man-yells-at-airflow:`).

## 🚀 Installation Guide: Adding the Emojis to Slack

Because Slack does not offer a native bulk upload feature, the fastest way to get all these emojis into your workspace is by using a **browser extension** that adds bulk upload functionality to the customization page.

### Recommended Method: Browser Extension

We highly recommend using a tool like the **Neutral Face Emoji Tools** extension (available for Chrome and Firefox).

#### Step 1: Download the Starter Pack

1. Click the green **`< > Code`** button at the top of this repository.

2. Select **`Download ZIP`**.

3. Unzip the file on your computer.

#### Step 2: Install the Browser Extension

1. Search for and install the **Neutral Face Emoji Tools** extension for your browser (Chrome or Firefox).

#### Step 3: Bulk Upload to Slack

1. In your browser, navigate to your Slack workspace's emoji customization page:

   * `https://[your-workspace].slack.com/customize/emoji`

2. You should see a new **"Bulk Emoji Uploader"** box added by the extension.

3. **Drag the entire unzipped emoji folder** (e.g., `old-man-yells-at-starter-pack-main/`) into this box.

4. The extension will automatically process and upload all emojis, using the filename (without the extension) as the emoji name.

### Alternative Method: Manual Upload

If you cannot use a browser extension, you must upload the files one by one:

1. Navigate to `https://[your-workspace].slack.com/customize/emoji`.

2. Click the **"Add Emoji"** button.

3. Select an image file from the downloaded folder.

4. Enter the file name (e.g., `old-man-yells-at-aws`) as the emoji name.

5. Repeat until your rage is fully expressed!
